Native Keyword
--------------------

  *The native keyword is applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface). native is a modifier applicable only for methods and we can’t apply it anywhere else.

The main objectives of the native keyword are: 
---------------------------------------------------
*To improve the performance of the system.
*To achieve machine level/memory level communication.
*To use already existing legacy non-java code.

*The main advantage of native keyword is improvement in performance but the main disadvantage of native keyword is that it breaks platform-independent nature of java.

Syntax: Declaring Native Methods
---------------------------------------
private native String getLine(String prompt);

// Class 1
// Helper class to illustrate native keyword 
class Native
{

    static
    {
        System.loadLibrary("Native library path");
    }

    // Native method 
    public native void m();
}

// Main class 
class GFG
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // creating object of helper class inside main() 
        Native n = new Native();

        // Calling native method that is defined
        // inside  the above class
        n.m();
    }
}
