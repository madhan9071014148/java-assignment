Multiprocessing
------------------
*Multiprocessing refers to using multiple CPUs/processors in a single system. Multiple CPUs can act in a parallel fashion and executes multiple processes together. They increase computing power to a great extent. Symmetric multiprocessing and asymmetric multiprocessing are two types of multiprocessing.

*Multiple processes are executed in a parallel fashion.

*Multiprocessing can be classified into symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing.

*Process creation is time-consuming.
